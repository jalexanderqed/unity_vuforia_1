For this project, I elected to build an Android-based AR system with Vuforia and Unity. To make up for the increased ease of using Unity, I completed both of the extra-credit options. The app maintains the rotation of the teapot when it is picked up and put down, and the user can pick up and place the teapot by tapping on it.

I had to delete the "Plugins" folder in order to make the file small enough, but all of my code should be present.
